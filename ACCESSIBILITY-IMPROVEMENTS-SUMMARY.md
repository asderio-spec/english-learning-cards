  - `Enter`: Flip card
  - `Space`: Play/stop audio
  - `Esc`: Stop audio playback
- Added `onKeyDown` handler for card flip functionality
- Prevented default behavior for handled keys

### GradeSelector.tsx

  - `←` / `↑` Arrow keys: Move to previous grade
  - `→` / `↓` Arrow keys: Move to next grade
  - `Enter` / `Space`: Select current grade
- Added focus management to highlight selected grade
- Added `data-grade` attributes for keyboard navigation targeting

### General Keyboard Support
- All interactive elements support keyboard navigation
- Proper focus management and visual focus indicators
- Tab order follows logical flow of the interface

## 3. Screen Reader Compatibility

### Live Regions
- Added `aria-live="polite"` for progress updates and non-critical information
- Added `aria-live="assertive"` for error messages and critical alerts
- Added `role="status"` for dynamic content updates

### Semantic Structure
- Proper heading hierarchy (`h1` → `h2` → `h3`)
- Semantic HTML elements (`main`, `nav`, `aside`, `section`, `article`)
- Descriptive text content and labels

### Content Accessibility
- All images and icons have `aria-hidden="true"` when decorative
- All interactive elements have descriptive labels
- Form controls properly associated with labels
- Error messages clearly announced to screen readers

## 4. Color Contrast and Visual Accessibility

### Improved Color Contrast
- Updated text colors for better contrast ratios:
  - `text-gray-500` → `text-gray-600` (improved contrast)
  - `text-gray-400` → `text-gray-500` (improved contrast)
  - Button colors use darker shades for better contrast
- Enhanced button styling with stronger color combinations

### Focus Indicators
- Enhanced focus styles with `focus:ring-4` classes
- Improved focus visibility with stronger outline colors
- Added high contrast mode support in CSS

### CSS Accessibility Features
```css
/* Better focus styles for accessibility */
button:focus-visible,
a:focus-visible,
[role="button"]:focus-visible {
  outline: 3px solid #2563EB;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

/* High contrast focus for better visibility */
@media (prefers-contrast: high) {
  button:focus-visible,
  a:focus-visible,
  [role="button"]:focus-visible {
    outline: 4px solid #000000;
    outline-offset: 2px;
  }
}

/* Reduced motion preferences */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *,
  *::before,
  *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;
  }
}
```

## 5. Mobile Accessibility

### User Feedback
- Success messages with appropriate ARIA live regions
- Loading states with proper status indicators
- Clear feedback for all user interactions

## 7. Testing and Validation

### Accessibility Test Suite
